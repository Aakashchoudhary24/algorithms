# Data Structures and Algorithms
## Purpose : DSA Practice – Stay Sharp, Stay Ready

This repository is my daily effort to stay consistent with Data Structures and Algorithms. No matter how good your development skills are, DSA is still a gatekeeper for most exams and interviews — so this is my way of making sure I don't mess up when it counts.


## Goals

- Practice at least one DSA concept every day.
- Build a strong foundation to crack interviews and competitive exams.
- Organize everything neatly by topic.
- Learn Java along the way.
